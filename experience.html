			<a class="role"> Software Engineering Intern </a>
			<a class="company"> Pacific Life Insurance Company (PL) </a>
			<a class="date2"> June 2025 - present </a>
			<a class="date2"> Newport Beach, CA </a>
			<a class="text"> I worked on the Engineering Excellence team's Site Reliability Engineering subteam, where I identified incident 
				and change requests to improve system reliability and reduce Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR). Using Python and Pandas, I extracted 
				and processed data from the ServiceNow API to analyze trends, then built a dashboard website with Matplotlib visualizations and 
				compiled a stakeholder-facing report highlighting key reliability metrics and incident hotspots. I also contributed to the 
				Technology Shared Services team by tailoring IT services and resources to the specific needs of different roles across 
				divisions. I led a cross-functional research initiative to map organizational roles into personas by division, conducted user 
				interviews to uncover both physical and digital needs, and created mind maps and personas to inform IT provisioning and service 
				optimization. </a>
