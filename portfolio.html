			<a class="text"> Inspired by my passion for UI/UX design and programming, I decided to partake a personal programming project during 
				break. To further enhance my web development and problem-solving skills, I decided to code a personal website using HTML, CSS, 
				and JavaScript. Design wise, I decided to create a navigation bar with 5 tabs: Home, About, Experience, Portfolio, and Contact. 
				The Home page includes an image of me, professional summary, and link to my resume. The About page includes my education, skills, 
				and crucial college courses. The Experience page involves my work experience, clubs/societies, and awards. The Portfolio page 
				combines my CS and UI/UX design projects and coding experiences. The Contact page provides my LinkedIn, primary email, phone 
				number, and GitHub repository. </a>

			<a class="text"> Sketched and prototyped a new and more user-friendly version of Twitter. Created a user story, conducted an expert review, 
				and designed paper and digital wireframes, mockups, and an interactive prototype for Twitter's mobile and desktop versions. This was a

			<a class="text"> Conducted user research and created a persona for Twitter. Recruited and interviewed 5 participants, following with brief 
				analysis on Figma and ending with a persona design. Created and followed an interview protocol, recorded interview notes, and reflected 
				throughout the processes. Since no user interface is perfect, design improvements were suggested. This was a team effort. </a>

			<a class="text"> Designed and coded a web application called Mind Bloom in 12 hours. Used ChatGPT's API to develop a database & chatbot to track 
				& provide insights/feedback for individuals' moods based on a survey to tackle procrastination. Worked on the front-end UI mainly with 
				TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, & HTML. Created a project proposal, devpost with a brief requirements specification, pitch deck for presentation, 
				and a GitHub repository for team contributions. Formally presented our project to multiple judges, mentors, and other groups. Application 
				uses the HTTP url: http://localhost:3000/. </a>

			<h1 class="pacman"> A Human-Centered Analysis of Instagram </h1>

			<a class="text-pacman-end"> Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Instagram's interface to evaluate its adherence to usability and 
				accessibility principles using Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) frameworks. Applied W3C's accesibility principles and usability 
				principles in "Designing the User Interface" by Ben Shneiderman. Identified key strengths and areas for improvement to enhance 
				user experience for diverse audiences, including older users. </a>
			
			<h1 class="pacman"> Grin Language </h1>
			<a class="date-pacman"> May 2024 </a>
			<a class="text-pacman"> Language Design Backend Project </a>
			<div class="text2-container">
				<a class="text2-project" href="https://github.com/exliang/Grin-Language"> Github </a>
			</div>
			<a class="text-pacman-end"> Created a new programming language with 13 keywords and an infinite amount of statements possible. The 13 
				keywords include: LET, PRINT, INNUM, INSTR, ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, END, IF. Specifically, GOTO and GOSUB allow 
				line jumping when executing the program's statements. An option to start a statement with a label is possible as well. In the 
				console, the user can then type as many Grin statements as wanted, and all Grin programs end with a period. After execution of the 
				Grin statements, the result will be printed in the console. </a>

			<h1 class="pacman"> Airport Database GUI </h1>

			<div class="text2-container">
				<a class="text2-project" href="https://github.com/exliang/Airport-Database-GUI"> Github </a>
			</div>
			<a class="text-pacman-end"> Programmed a way for users to interact on a graphical user interface using Python and SQLite to add, 
				delete, and change information in an airport database. The database consisted of 8 tables: continent, country, region, airport, 
				airport_frequency, navigation_aid, runway, sqlite_master. Focused on 4 main events: application, continent, country, and region 
				with 3-4 subevents for each. For instance, for each continent, country, and region, users can interact on the simple GUI to search, 
				load, and save new and existing continents, countries, and regions. Generator functions were also used for memory optimization, and 
				exception handling was implemented for the GUI (which was not the main focus of this project). </a>

			<h1 class="pacman"> Pacman 2.0 </h1>
			<a class="date-pacman"> January 2023 - June 2023 </a>
			<a class="text-pacman"> Capstone Senior Project </a>
			<a class="text-pacman-end"> Progammed an enhanced version of Pacman with my groupmate in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed and coded 
				multiple levels (10) and maps (10), receiving posive feedback. As the levels increase, the maps get larger and more complex with 
				the addition of ghosts. The process of building was creating a project proposal, building the maps/UI, coding the movement of the 
				ghosts and Pacmans (we had an option for a multiplayer mode as well), etc. From this process, I learned how to effectively 
				collaborate and communicate with my teammate to finish the project in the given time frame successfully. If we had more time, I 
				would've wanted to add an option to choose how many ghosts you want for each level and map. Game could be accessed through a 
				unique IP address, which I unfortunately don't have access to anymore. </a>
