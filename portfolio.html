		<a class="text"> Participated in a three-day virtual design event, collaborating with a team of four as a UX/UI Designer and Researcher

			news updates, nearby resources, and disaster preparation tools. Our research focused on improving public awareness and preparedness 
			while emphasizing human connection. We conducted user surveys and competitive analyses to inform our design decisions. The design

		<a class="text"> FirstStep is a mobile walking app designed to integrate social accountability and gamification to combat rising 
			physical inactivity, helping users find the time, energy, and motivation to stay active. Developed as part of Design at UCI's 
			Project Teams, a quarter-long design program, the project brought together UX/UI designers, graphic designers, and project leaders 
			to design a prototype from scratch. As a UX/UI Designer and Researcher in a team of five, key contributions included identifying a 
			problem statement, conducting user research through competitive analyses, user surveys, and interviews, and determining an 
			effective solution. The design process involved creating user flow charts, wireframing, and prototyping in Figma, focusing on 
			three main pages: walking, social, and stats. FirstStep placed 3rd out of 9 teams, highlighting its impact and innovative approach 
			to encouraging physical activity. </a>

			ghosts and Pacmans (we had an option for a multiplayer mode as well), etc. From this process, I learned how to effectively 
			collaborate and communicate with my teammate to finish the project in the given time frame successfully. If we had more time, I 
			would've wanted to add an option to choose how many ghosts you want for each level and map. Game could be accessed through a
